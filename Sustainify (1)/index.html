        About us
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sustainify is a new website dedicated to helping connect students and faculty
        across the University of Waterloo campus to sustainable projects and initiatives.
        Sustainify hopes that clubs, groups, stores, restaurants and event organizers will
        share and create on-campus events and destinations for both students and faculty to
        create a more sustainable UW.
      </p>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <h3>Event organizers and Club Leaders</h3>
      <p>
        Clubs and event organizers will sign up for an account on Sustainify
        to create and publish sustainability-focused events on our website. These
        events will be put on the campus map and all users will be able to find out
        more information about this event and register to take part. After the event
        takes place, users will be able to check-in with the hosts and to cofirm
        event attendance. Here's the catch: we have rewards for users who distinguish
        themselves and participate actively.
