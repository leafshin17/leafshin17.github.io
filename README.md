# Sustainify

Hackathon project created for UWaterloo Energy Hacks

Sustainify is an event management and ticketing platform where students of the same university can attend programs that are geared towards sustainability. Events like community-wide cleanups, sustainable workshops and tree planting can be hosted within the platform. Event info can then be accessed through a user's account along with the google maps API.
