        About Us
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sustainify is a new website dedicated to helping connect students and
        faculty across the University of Waterloo campus to sustainable projects
        and initiatives. Sustainify hopes that clubs, groups, stores,
        restaurants and event organizers will share and create on-campus events
        and destinations for both students and faculty to create a more
        sustainable UW. Here's the perk: we have rewards for users who
        distinguish themselves and participate actively.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <h3>New Users</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you want to attend sustainability events, find local businesses
        that support this initiative, or would like to find the nearest green
        transportation, Sustainify is for you! Register with us to be an active
        user and receive rewards for your participation.
      </p>
      <h3>Event organizers and Club Leaders</h3>
      <p>
        Clubs and event organizers will sign up for an account on Sustainify to
        create and publish sustainability-focused events on our website. These
        events will be put on the campus map and all users will be able to find
        out more information about this event and register to take part. After
        the event takes place, users will be able to check-in with the hosts and
        to cofirm event attendance.
      </p>
      <h3>Sustainable Businesses</h3>
      <p>
        Sustainify encourages business owners of all kinds to register to become
        a sustainable business and receive marked locations on our website's
        map. We also ecourage owners to sponser incentives and rewards for
        active users, to promote business traffic and success in our
        sustainability efforts.
